# Enemies

Enemies are defined in the `enemies.yaml` file.  
It is important to note that enemies defined in this file are *templates*, not actually enemies themselves.

For example, if there is 1 "spider" enemy defined in `enemies.yaml`, there could be any number of spider enemies generated in a playthrough of the game. This is because an entry in `enemies.yaml` defines an enemy template: a blueprint for how to generate enemies in game. This blueprint format makes it very easy to create many different types of enemies that can spawn in game. It also allows for variety in the attack power, XP, defence, and other traits of the enemy.
